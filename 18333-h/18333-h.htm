<p>
Our gracious Sovereign&mdash;more so even than his deceased father, who had
also a conspicuous gift that way&mdash;has ever shown a singular felicity
in voicing the sentiments of his people, but never more so than when
he sent this message to Sir John French: "The splendid pluck, spirit,
and endurance shown by my troops in the desperate fighting which has
continued for so many days against vastly superior forces fills me with
admiration." That sovereign message to his heroic soldiers&mdash;such as his
ancestor Henry V. might have addressed to his 10,000 long-enduring
conquerors on the night of Agincourt&mdash;was nobly supplemented by this
passage from the following day's Speech from the Throne: "My Navy and
Army continue, throughout the area of conflict, to maintain in full
measure their glorious traditions. We watch and follow their
steadfastness and valour with thankfulness and pride, and there is,
throughout my Empire, a fixed determination to secure, at whatever
sacrifice, the triumph of our arms and the vindication of our cause."

While it fell to H.M.A.S. "Sydney" to bring the "Emden" to action,
another vessel of the Australian Navy, the "Melbourne," also joined in
the pursuit. The Admiralty stated that a "large combined operation by
fast cruisers against the 'Emden' has been for some time in progress.
In this search, which covered an immense area, the British cruisers have
been aided by French, Russian, and Japanese vessels working in harmony.
H.M.A.S. 'Melbourne' and 'Sydney' were also included in these
movements."

At whatever sacrifice! And that promises to be terrible. For what will
be the sacrifice entailed by two years of war&mdash;to put its duration at
a moderate estimate&mdash;if our casualties in life and limb alone (compared
with which our millions of money are as nothing) amounted, according to
an official statement in Parliament, to about 57,000 of all ranks up
to the end of October, and it is believed that 10,000 at least must be
added for the first ten days of November? Of course, by far the larger
portion of those casualties are "wounded," of whom, according to one of
the Netley authorities, nine in ten at least ought to recover; while
those casualties also include "missing," or "prisoners," of whom the
Germans claim to have now more than 16,000 in their keeping. In the
Boer War our "wounded" amounted to 22,829,

<!-- PAGE OVERLAP SPLICED -->

of which only 2018 proved fatal cases; while our total casualties for
over two and a-half years of warfare, including 13,250 deaths from
disease&mdash;which, in every campaign, is always far more fatal than lead
or steel&mdash;figured up to 52,204, as compared with 57,000 in France and
Belgium for only three months, or considerably more than twice the
number of men (26,000) whom we landed in the Crimea; while the purely
British contingent of Wellington's "Allies" at Waterloo was returned
at something like 24,000.

SYBARITISM IN THE TRENCHES! A HOT SHOWER-BATH
ESTABLISHMENT INSTALLED BY AN INGENIOUS FRENCH ENGINEER.
</p>
<p>
Much has been said of the elaborate character of the German
entrenchments, and of the British genius for comfort developed in our
own lines, but it is doubtful whether anything done by either side in
that direction has surpassed the <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> of an ingenious
French engineer shown in our illustration. At one point in the French
trenches not seven hundred yards from those of the enemy, and within
two miles of the German artillery, he constructed an up-to-date bathing
establishment, with a heating apparatus and a shower-bath! The apartment
was fitted with a stove, benches, clothes-pegs, and curtains; and
adjoining the <i>salle de douches</i>, or shower-bath room, was fitted
up a <i>salle de coiffure</i>. There was even talk of enlivening the
bathing hour with music and a topical revue.

SIMILAR TO THE KAISER'S AERIAL BODYGUARD: A ZEPPELIN WITH
A GUN ON TOP FIRING AT HOSTILE AEROPLANES&mdash;A GERMAN PICTURE.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0em; font-size: 75%;">
It was stated recently that two Zeppelins, armed with machine-guns,
circle continually on guard above the Kaiser's private apartments in his
headquarters at Coblentz.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It must be remembered, too, that the casualties referred to&mdash;being
confined to "the western area of the war"&mdash;do not include our losses at
sea, which comprise few "wounded" and no "missing." At sea it is either
neck or nothing, sink or swim: a modern battle-ship, if holed and
exploded, like the <i>Good Hope</i> and the <i>Monmouth</i> off the
coast of Chile, going to the bottom, and most of her crew with her, like
Kempenfelt's oaken <i>Royal George</i>&mdash;
</p>


<p class="i">   Brave Kempenfelt is gone,</p>
<p class="i2">    His victories are o'er;</p>
<p class="i">   And he and his eight hundred</p>
<p class="i2">    Will plough the waves no more.</p>


<p style="clear:right;">
Thus if our casualties at sea, which are mainly of one kind only, be
added up, they will probably be found to exceed our deaths on land,
which are always much less numerous than other kinds of losses; yet the
mortality of our battlefields has been mournful enough, especially among
officers&mdash;where the death percentage has been higher than in any other
war we ever waged.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the Germans have had to pay a fearful price for
the death-toll they have exacted of us and our Allies, seeing that,
according to their own official admission, their casualties to the end
of September amounted to over 500,000 for the Prussian army alone, while
<!-- ACTUAL COLUMN SPLIT HERE -->
the corresponding figures for Bavaria, Würtemberg, Baden, and other
States have to be added; so that the estimate of Mr. Hilaire Belloc that
the total losses of the Germans up to date must be somewhere near a
million and three-quarters men would appear to be not very far out.
</p>
<p>
Well now, supposing that the war were to last for two years, it follows
that, at the same rate of loss, the German casualties would amount to
12,250,000, which is almost unthinkable. Its very destructiveness should
tend to shorten the duration of this terrible war. As Mr. Asquith said
at the opening of Parliament, in a curiously cryptic and significant
passage: "The war may last long. I doubt myself if it will last as long
as many people originally predicted." God grant that this may be so!
</p>
<p>
But in the meantime there are no signs of any abatement of fury on the
part of the Imperial Hun of Berlin, who stamps, and struts, and rages
like Pistol on the field of Agincourt; and "Bid him prepare, for I will
cut his throat!" is ever the burden of his objurgations. How different
from the calm, serene, dignified utterances of our own gracious
Sovereign and the despatches of his Generals are the minatory rantings
of the Kaiser, his von Klucks, and his Crown Princes of Bavaria, with
their vicious appeals to the worst passions of their soldiers against
the English as the most bitterly hated of all their foes!

<p>
Full of years and honours, Lord Roberts has met death upon the Field of
Honour as surely as though he had died fighting at the head of the brave
soldiers whom he loved so well. To enumerate his qualities: indomitable
courage, keen intelligence, broad humanity, is to gild refined gold.
At the call of duty he visited the Army and the Indian soldiers in
France, despite his eighty-two years; there he caught a chill and passed
peacefully away. The message to Lady Roberts by Field-Marshall Sir John
French will find universal echo: "...Your grief is shared by us who
mourn the loss of a much-loved chief ... It seems a fitter ending to the
life of so great a soldier that he should have passed away in the midst
of the troops he loved so well and within the sound of the guns."

Most bitterly hated, but at the same time most formidable&mdash;as the
Germans themselves now generally admit, and hence all those tears of
rage&mdash;<i>hinc illae lacrymae</i>. Even when the Prussian Guards&mdash;not to
speak of the vaunted
<!-- PAGE OVERLAP SPLICED DOWN -->
Brandenburgers and Bavarians&mdash;can make no impression on the British
lines in Belgium, it should at last break in upon the German General
Staff that they are somewhat out in their calculations. The word

and it will be used still less when this army shall have been reinforced
by the million of men apart altogether from the Territorials which are
now under training to supplement it, while a further million has now, in
turn, been asked for and will be cheerfully raised, with the help of the
additional vote of credit for £250,000,000&mdash;which was just about the
cost of the Boer War, and £25,000,000 more than the French indemnity of
1870&mdash;which will be willingly granted by Parliament for the conduct of a
war that is said to be costing us about £7,000,000 a week. When a young
man throws all his soul into his training and ardently wants to become
a soldier, his progress will be at least three times as quick as that of
the dull, driven conscript; and that is why Lord Kitchener has told us
that the new million-man'd army which popularly bears his name, though
it might just as well be called after the King&mdash;has already been making
a wonderful advance towards field-efficiency.

The "Niger," a torpedo-gunboat of 810 tons, built in 1892, was torpedoed
by a German submarine while lying off Deal about noon on the 11th, and
foundered. The Admiralty stated: "All the officers and 77 of the men
were saved; two of the men are severely and two slightly injured. It is
thought there was no loss of life."&mdash;[<i>Photo. by L.N.A.</i>]

<p>
The English writer of one of the many war-books now before the
public&mdash;"The German Army From Within," by one who has served in it as an
officer, tells us that he calculates one of our "Tommies" to be at least
equal to three "Hans Wursts"; and when the personal equation is taken
into account&mdash;the value of individual character and initiative&mdash;the
estimate will not seem to be exaggerated. In fact, it has been proved to
be correct by the opinion of all our best judges in the field itself,
as well as by the results of the fighting when the odds against us have
been invariably three to one, in spite of which we have always managed,
not only to maintain our ground, but also to encroach on that of our
antagonists.
</p>
<p>
Hence it follows that a so-called "Kitchener" army of a million men
ought to have for us a military value of at least three millions as
against the Germans&mdash;the more so since their best first-line troops
have already been used up, and replaced with beardless boys and most
corpulent greybeards. This is not a fanciful description; it corresponds
with the reports sent home by "Eye-Witness" at Headquarters and other
reliable observers; while there is an absolute consensus of statement
that our soldiers enjoy a commissariat system which is at once the
admiration of their French friends and the sheer envy and despair of
their German foes. The fact alone that our men are better found and
better fed than the enemy gives them an advantage over and above their
three-to-one equivalent of the individual kind.

The devastating effect of shell-fire on human habitations is brought
out with appealing effect by the photograph which we give above of
the scene in one of the ill-fated Belgian townships on the frontier
of West Flanders. Wrecked and ruined houses with their walls leaning
over and tottering, about to fall in ruin, and the heaps of littered
<i>débris</i> in the street tell a fearful tale of what the havoc from a
bombardment by heavy projectiles means for the hapless inhabitants of
the place. The tremendous force of the impact with which the shells
crash down is shown at the same time by the man seen in the foreground
of the photograph standing up to the waist in one of the gaping cavities
in the ground that the shells make where they strike. In some of the
houses they smash through from roof to cellar.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Illus.

Major the Hon. William Cadogan, son of Earl Cadogan, and Equerry to the
Prince of Wales, was killed while commanding the 10th Hussars in place
of the Colonel, who had been wounded. Major Cadogan had been sharing in
the work of the infantry in the trenches. He served in South Africa,
and last year accompanied the Prince of Wales, who travelled as the
"Earl of Chester," on a visit to Germany, where our photograph was
taken.&mdash;[<i>Photograph by Illus. Bureau</i>.]

<p>
Besides, they have sources of inspiration&mdash;have our "Tommies"&mdash;denied
to their Teutonic antagonists. General von Kluck, Commander of the First
German Army, has described a visit of the dread War Lord to the line of
the Aisne "behind the line of fire"; and the "Hochs" with which he was
greeted by a Prussian Grenadier regiment. But what
<!-- TEXT SPLICED DOWN -->
are those guttural "Hochs" compared with the ringing cheers which were
evoked by the presence of Lord Roberts on the occasion of his last visit
to his old comrades-in-arms of the Indian Army, now confronting those
Prussian Grenadiers on the line of the Yser? When Lord Roberts was made
a Peer, after his march from Cabul to Candahar, he chose as his heraldic
supporters a Gurkha and a Gordon Highlander, who had done so much to
help him on to victory; and it is pretty certain that he would have
desired no more congenial and appropriate manner of death than he has
found, at the age of eighty-two, as an inspiring visitor to the lines
of the gallant troops of all kinds whom he himself had so often led to
victory. It has been said that no man can be called happy until his
death, and certainly no one was ever more felicitous in the manner of
his end than the veteran hero, the blameless "Bayard" of the British
Army, who has well been called one of Ireland's greatest Englishmen.
</p>
<p>
Yet his name will continue to serve as an inspiration to the Army which
adored him; and doubtless his last moments were soothed by the thought
that the soldiers whom he so fervently loved had just added to their
laurels by the brave repulse on the Yser of two Brigades, or a Division,
of the boasted Prussian Guards, forming the very flower and kernel of
the Kaiser's army. And news also must have reached the conqueror of
Paardeburg and Pretoria that the German-prompted and German-paid
rebellion against the Union of which he had laid the
foundation-stone&mdash;not with the trowel of an architect, but with the
sword of a soldier&mdash;was collapsing under the well-directed blows of such
an Imperial patriot and statesman as General Botha, proud to wear the
uniform of the hero of Candahar.
</p>
<p>
Thus the last hours of our veteran Field-Marshal must have been consoled
with the reflection that, in spite of the fact of all his warnings and
his exhortations having fallen on deaf ears, victory was gilding our
arms, as well as those of our Allies, all round; and that the loss of
two of our cruisers off the coast of Chile had been more than offsetted
by the destruction of the notorious commerce-destroyer <i>Emden</i> in the
seas of Sumatra and the cornering of the equally elusive <i>Königsberg</i>
among the palm-trees of an East African lagoon&mdash;fit incident for the
pages of Captain Marryat or Mr. George Henty, beloved of the
boy-devourers of stirring adventure books.
</p>
<p>
During the last week two rivers have again formed the main scenes of
action in the far-extended theatre of war&mdash;one the Yser, in Belgium,
where the advance of the Germans on Calais has been "stone-walled" by
the Allies; and the other on the Vistula, in Poland, where the Russians,
by sheer force of numbers and superior strategy, made very considerate
progress in their march on Berlin; so that, on the whole, the horoscope
remained most favourable to the Allies and the ultimate attainment of
their Common object.

In the recent victorious operations of the Russian Army the cavalry have
taken a conspicuous part. The Headquarters announcement from Petrograd
of November 10 said: "To the east of Neidenburg near the station of
Muschaken (in East Prussia, about two miles from the frontier), Russian
cavalry defeated a German detachment which was guarding the railway,
captured transport, and blew up two bridges over the railway. On the 8th
inst. our cavalry forced one of the enemy's cavalry divisions, which was
supported by a battalion of rifles, to retreat towards Kalisz (near the
border of German Poland)." The above drawing shows an engagement in
Hungary between an Austro-Hungarian force and a body of Russian cavalry
who had crossed the Carpathians from Galicia.

Dixmude, after a comparative lull since it was first bombarded by the
Germans, recently became once more the objective of a fierce attack and
fell into the enemy's hands. The afternoon <i>communiqué</i> issued in
Paris on November 11 said: "At the end of the day (<i>i.e.</i>, the
10th) the Germans had succeeded in taking possession of Dixmude. We are
still holding on to the outskirts of this village, on the canal from
Nieuport to Ypres, which has been strongly occupied. The struggle has
been very fierce at these points." The late French <i>communiqué</i>
issued the same night said: "The enemy throughout the day continued his
effort of yesterday without achieving any fresh results.... He made vain
attempts to debouch from Dixmude on the left bank of the
Yser."&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations</i>.]

Although the Germans undoubtedly scored a slight success by their
occupation of Dixmude, they did so at enormous cost. It was reported
from Amsterdam on the 11th that 4000 Germans severely wounded in the
fighting round Dixmude had reached Liége. Dixmude was for three weeks
gallantly defended by French Marines. The town is now little more than a
heap of ruins. As our photographs show, the fine old church of St. Jean
has been almost completely wrecked, and the Hotel de Ville has suffered
great damage. It has been pointed out that the military value of Dixmude
to the Germans is not very great, as it does not form part of the
Allies' defensive line, but was held as a bridge-head on the east bank
of the Yser.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations</i>.]

Dixmude, on the Yser, suffered terribly during the earlier stages of
the great battle in West Flanders. It was stated on October 27 that
French Marines holding the town had withstood a continuous attack lasting
forty hours, at the end of which the place was in ruins. Mr. E. Ashmead
Bartlett, who visited Dixmude on October 21, wrote (in the "Telegraph"):
"The town is not very big, and what it looked like before the
bombardment I cannot say.... An infuriated German army corps were
concentrating the fire of all the field guns and heavy howitzers on it
at the same time. There was not an inch that was not being swept by
shells. There was not a house, as far as I could see, which had escaped
destruction."&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Newspaper Illustrations</i>.]

Some idea of the destruction wrought by German shells in Nieuport may
be gathered from this photograph of the interior of the church, another
example of the fact, pointed out under a drawing on another page, that
the German gunners do not respect the House of God. The church at
Nieuport, which dated from the fifteenth century, was restored in 1903,
and its massive baroque tower, visible from afar, could be easily
avoided by artillerymen capable of accurate aim and desirous of sparing
a sacred building. Nieuport has at least twice before in history been
the scene of conflict. In 1489 it made a stubborn resistance to an
attack by the French, and near it, in July 1660, was fought the Battle
of the Dunes between the Dutch and the Spaniards.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by

churches. The German gunners, on the contrary, show no respect for the
House of God, although their Emperor so often claims Divine approval.
The havoc wrought by German shells in French and Belgian churches
and cathedrals stands recorded in countless photographs and other

warfare that will make her name execrated by posterity. In the present

It has been pointed out by a Naval correspondent that the German bayonet
of which one edge is a saw is not really quite the barbarous weapon it
seems, but is similiar to that carried by pioneers in British naval
landing-parties, for use in sawing wood. The toothed edge, he mentions,
is so far from the point that only by the rarest chance could it enter
the body of an enemy. It would be interesting to know whether the two
bayonets British and German&mdash;are exactly similar. Another account of the
German weapon states that the saw-edge begins only six inches from the
point, quite near enough thereto, one would imagine, to "enter the body
of an enemy." Inset is an enlargement of the German
saw-bayonet&mdash;[<i>Photo. by L.N.A.</i>]

Dixmude, the name of which little West Flanders town on the Yser all the
world knows now, after being heroically defended against persistent
night-and-day attacks and bombardments at all hours, was taken by the
reinforced Germans after a forty-hours renewed attack on November 11.
The defenders, however, held out in the outskirts of the town, and could
not be dislodged.
The post is not part of the Allied main line, but rather of value as
a bridge-head over the river. The French naval officer who sent the
photographs shown above was one of the defenders until he had to
withdraw wounded. When he was there Dixmude had been defended by 6000
French sailors, reinforced at the end of October by 1500 Algerian
soldiers.

One of War's "little ironies" finds illustration in our photograph. A
great conflict such as that now being waged is full of contrasts: grins,
pathetic, sometimes not without a suggestion of humour. That the German
Marine should be told off in a pretty rural district to round up cattle
for food for the German troops is a case in point. The sleek and shapely
kine which these sturdy fellows are commandeering plod peacefully along
in happy ignorance of the fact that they are prisoners of war being led
to their doom by an armed guard. If it were not for the significance of
the weapons borne by the Marines, the scene would be as purely pastoral
as that immortalised by Gray. It suggests the "lowing herd"&mdash;with a
difference.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Photopress</i>.]

The "Pegasus," an old and small cruiser, was attacked and disabled by
the German cruiser "Königsberg" (recently trapped by the "Chatham" in
an East African river), a modern ship of larger size and much heavier
metal, at daybreak on September 20, while anchored in Zanzibar harbour
to clean boilers. The "Königsberg" stole up during the night, sheltered
behind an island off the shore and, easily outranging the guns of the
"Pegasus," shelled her helpless opponent. After that the German ship
drew off, leaving the "Pegasus" in a sinking condition and with 26 men
killed and 53 wounded. Our photograph, which has just been received
here, shows the "Pegasus'" wounded being transhipped to the Union Castle

<p>
The armed liner "Carmania," in her hour and a-half's fight of September
14 with the German armed liner "Cap Trafalgar," was hit by 73 of her
opponent's shells, the splinters making, it is stated, some 380 holes
all over the vessel. Offering so large a target to gun-fire as did
the "Carmania"&mdash;a ship of great length, standing 60 feet out of the
water&mdash;she was saved from suffering more damage by the seamanship of
Captain Noel Grant, R.N., her Captain, who kept her end-on to the enemy.
Our photograph of the navigating bridge of the "Carmania," with the
engine-room telegraphs wrecked and fragments of metal strewn about, will
give an idea of what those on board went through. It has just reached
this country.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Farringdon Co.</i>]

</p>
<p>
It is clear that the German incendiary outrages in Belgium and France
were premeditated, and German scientists devised special apparatus for
setting fire to buildings. Our informant, who bought some incendiary
disks from a German soldier near Antwerp, states that every man carries
twenty bags, each containing about 300 disks. Mr. Bertram Blount, the
analyst, found the disks consist of nitro-cellulose, or gun-cotton.
They may be lit, even when wet, with a match or cigarette-end, and
burn for eleven or twelve seconds, emitting a strong five-inch flame,
and entirely consuming themselves. The Germans throw them alight into
houses. The photographs show (1) a bag of disks as supplied to German
soldiers; (2) a disk burning; and (3) a disk, actual size, before being
used.

<p>
The German heavy "batteries of position" are for the most part
armed-with the 15 cm., or 6-inch howitzer, throwing a shell of 90 lb.
with an approximate range of 6650 yards. The howitzer type of mobile
heavy gun is much favoured for defensive work in both the German and the
Austrian armies. The howitzer is capable of elevation up to 65 deg., the
idea of this high elevation being, it is stated, to obtain a steep angle
of descent for the shells at comparatively short ranges, in combination
with a high remaining velocity so as to ensure the penetration of
overhead cover. These howitzers are also employed in siege and fortress
defence warfare. They have been used along the Aisne positions as
auxiliaries to the giant Krupp siege-howitzers.

Cavalry engaged in the Belgian frontier battles are fighting in all
sorts of ways: repeatedly, for example, as infantrymen in the trenches.
On occasion, also, they have even charged on foot, with bayonet or with
their lances. The Life Guards, according to a letter from the front,
charged the German trenches the other day with bayonets. A squadron of
French dragoons dismounted and crept through a wood on foot, surprising
a German infantry company and overpowering them in close-quarter fight
with lances and clubbed carbines.

With lances, also, as our illustration shows, some of our Bengal cavalry, in
action on foot, on October 24, at Ramscapelle, near the Yser, recaptured
the village from the Germans. Dismounting near by, they charged the enemy
lance in hand, driving him from his trenches. Following up their success,
they then forced their way into the village, smashing in doors and windows
and storming house after house in spite of fierce resistance until,
assisted by other troops, they forced the enemy out, capturing guns and
many prisoners.  The action was particularly notable.

announced as having been laid before our authorities, many grants of the
"D.S.O." and "D.C.M." have already been garetted; and our French Allies
have awarded the Legion of Honour to several officers and men. Our first

There is something gruesomely appropriate in this photograph of the

grouped in a sort of hollow square about the graves of the officers and

Argonne district, the tract of rough country, between the sources of the

passes. How catastrophe befell this particular German convoy we can
guess. More than one of the enemy's transport trains, moving in this

bombardments by the French artillery as the result of aeroplane
reconnoitring activity&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Alfieri</i>.]

Early in the war, the Kaiser commissioned various painters to produce
battle-pictures of German prowess. The royal house of Bavaria has
apparently followed suit. More recently the Kaiser expressed a wish
that the British might meet the Bavarians "just once" and his wish was
gratified. In depicting a Bavarian cavalry fight with French dragoons,
the Bavarian artist naturally represents the enemy as going down like
nine-pins. Prince Heinrich, who figures in the drawing, is the only son
of the late Prince Francis Joseph of Bavaria, first cousin of Prince
Rupprecht, the Bavarian Crown Prince, who recently exhorted his troops
to conquer "our most hated foe." He also highly extolled the Bavarian
cavalry, who, he said, have fought "with the greatest fearlessness and
extraordinary dash."

GERMANY'S EASTERN STRONGHOLD WHICH SUFFERED THE FATE OF
LIÉGE AND ANTWERP: MEN OF THE GERMAN GARRISON AT TSING-TAU.
</p>
<p>
It is said that the German garrison at Tsing-tau, which surrendered
to the Japanese and British on November 7, included five battalions
of infantry, fire battalions of marine artillery, one battalion of
mechanics, and about 2500 reservists. After the surrender of the
garrison a number of German soldiers are said to have escaped in native
boats, but were recaptured. The defences were under naval control.
Tsing-tau was strongly fortified and had about 600 Krupp guns of various
calibre. The photographs show men of the Third Sea Battalion. (1) On the
march in Tsing-tau; (2) and (3) Entrenched with a machine-gun. Our
correspondent states that the photographs were taken since the siege
began; otherwise the dark band round the helmet-covers might be taken

<p>
At midnight on November 6&mdash;seven hours before the German garrison of
Tsing-tau surrendered, the central fort was captured by the Japanese,
who took 200 prisoners. The Germans had made great efforts to repair
their batteries, but the shell-fire from the Japanese guns was too
heavy. After the central fort had fallen the Japanese captured at the
point of the bayonet other forts and the strong field-works connecting
them. It was stated that some 2300 German prisoners were taken when
Tsing-tau surrendered. The German garrison, it is said, included four
companies of seaman gunners, an equal force of Marines, some cavalry and
field gunners, and a company of sappers. Probably the garrison increased
after the war began, as Germans from all parts of China gathered at
Tsing-tau for protection.

Considering the amount of discussion&mdash;not to say, in some quarters,
apprehension&mdash;to which the Zeppelins have given rise, singularly little
has been heard of them so far during the war, and, apart from the
Antwerp exploits, they have done practically no damage. On the other
hand, several have been destroyed: the number has been variously
estimated from two to six. One, said to be the "LZ10," was brought down
in October at Grandvilliers, ten miles from Belfort. Our photographs
show: (1) debris of the shattered framework; and (2) wreckage of the

batteries near Warsaw, and its broken remains were taken to Petrograd to
be examined. The British air-raid on Düsseldorf also accounted for one
or possibly two.

capable of holding a whole battalion. It had two entrances, one of which
is shown in the sketch. It was dark and dirty, but with plenty of straw

at Lao-shan Bay. They fought with great valour and suffered considerable
losses. Their casualties up to November 6 were given as 200 killed and
878 wounded. In the final assault they had 14 officers wounded and 426

Africa, with part of her crew entrenched on the banks. Unable to get
at her, she bottled up the "Königsberg" by sinking colliers in the
only navigable channel. The "Sydney" is a light cruiser of 5600 tons,
launched, as was the "Chatham," in 1911. The "Chatham" was practically a
sister ship of the "Sydney," but rather smaller, displacing 5400 tons,

WHERE ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS ARE NOT: GERMAN MACHINE-GUNS, ON
TEMPORARY MOUNTINGS, FOR USE AGAINST WAR-PLANES.
</p>
<p>
The Germans, according to paragraphs from their newspapers reprinted
here, sneer at the way London is guarding against hostile aircraft by
mounting quick-firing guns and searchlights and putting out many street
lamps. They are doing much the same themselves, however, in the cities
nearest their western frontier. At Cologne, ever since August, there has
been constant nervousness as to possible air-raids, and searchlights
from elevated points in the city have swept the sky nightly, and
machine-guns have been set up on tall buildings. At Düsseldorf when our
airmen destroyed a Zeppelin, the aviators were fired at by machine-guns
from all over the city. Our illustration shows German machine-guns in
temporary use as anti-aircraft guns.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by Photopress.</i>]

<p>
Among the French Colonial troops, the Senegalese have done excellent
work, both on the Aisne and, more recently, in Belgium. Our photograph
was taken near Pervyse, a village on the railway between Dixmunde
and Nieuport, which has been the scene of many fierce encounters.
In the Battle of the Aisne, when much night fighting took place, the
Senegalese, it was reported, whose dark complexions rendered their faces
less visible, proved very useful, and showed extraordinary daring.
A favourite ruse was to send them forward at night, and when they had
crawled near to the German lines, to turn powerful searchlights on the
enemy, who, blinded by the glare, could not see whence the attack came.
The Senegalese would then charge with the bayonet&mdash;[<i>Photo. by

MARTIAL LAW IN EGYPT: EXAMINING PASSPORTS AT PORT SAID

<p>
Martial Law was officially proclaimed by the British authorities in
Egypt on November 2, as the first and immediate result of the outbreak
of hostilities with Turkey. For some time before that, however, the
authorities had been taking precautionary measures in consequence of
the ubiquity and restless activity of the horde of German secret agents
and spies known to be busily at work, seeking to spread sedition and
disaffection among the natives. To prevent the transmission of military
and other intelligence to Constantinople by their emissaries, severe
restrictions have had to be imposed along the land-frontiers and in
particular at ports such as Alexandria, Port Said and Suez on all
persons entering or leaving the country. All passports and credentials
are subjected to a close scrutiny.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by C.N.</i>]

<p>
On Sunday, November 15, that brave soldier Albert King of the Belgians
was thirty-nine, and a solemn Mass was celebrated at Westminster
Cathedral. Cardinal Bourne assisted at the service, and the ceremonial
was of a most impressive and ornate character, gorgeous vestments,
beautiful music, and the gleam of many lights combining to make a
<i>tout ensemble</i> that suggested some great occasion of national
thanksgiving, as, indeed, it was. Scarlet and green were the brilliant
colour-notes of the function. The celebrant of the Mass was Mgr. Canon
Moyes, other dignitaries taking part in the service. Amongst the
congregation were the children of the King of the Belgians&mdash;Prince
Leopold, Duc de Brabant; Prince Charles, Comte de Flandre; and Princess
Marie-José, of all of whom we give portraits.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by C.N.</i>]

The King recently presented the white goat shown in the above photograph
to the 7th Battalion (Reserve) Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who, since they
were raised, have been in training at Newtown, Montgomeryshire. The
Welsh Fusiliers have always had a white goat as a mascot, drawn from the
famous herd of Cashmere goats which also supplied the King's gift. The
animal given by his Majesty to the new battalion was taken from Windsor
to Newtown under escort, and was received at the station by two men of
the 7th Royal Welsh Fusiliers, who stood with fixed bayonets. On the

<p>
Nothing could give a better idea of shell-fire than the remarkable
photograph here reproduced. It is a panoramic view of a German artillery
bombardment of advancing infantry, and was taken in three sections, well
within a hundred and fifty yards of some of the bursting shells. The
locality of the battle is in the Argonne country between the Upper Aisne
and the Meuse, where the French are having continuous and stiff
fighting. Men of the French infantry keeping under cover in one of their
advanced trenches are seen in the left foreground of the picture. The
object of the actual fighting on the occasion was to keep apart the
Third German army as it fell back towards prepared positions near the
Meuse and a force of reinforcing troops coming up from the direction of
Metz. "To impede the persistent advance of our &mdash;&mdash; corps,"

writes a French correspondent on the spot, the enemy resisted
vigorously and with his heavy artillery. He treated us to shells with
a veritable prodigality, but without causing us very serious losses.
In the forward movement, led by the &mdash;&mdash; infantry regiment, on an
important position that had to be taken, practically every soldier
engaged was saluted by six shells. There was, though, no 'shyness' among
our men. They laughed and joked with one another as they quitted the
trenches to move forward over the open. By the evening the enemy's
position had been taken." Both ordinary shrapnel and high-explosive
15-c.m. shells from the German heavy position-batteries of howitzers,
which weapons the Germans prefer for such work, although they also use
guns of the same calibre, are seen bursting in front of the French
troops.

<p>
Nieuport has been badly damaged by the German bombardment, and it is
said that half the houses in it appear to have been struck by
shells, yet that it has not been so utterly ruined as some of the
surrounding villages. The worst loss as regards buildings at Nieuport
has been the destruction of the church, which, as many photographs show
well, has been almost completely demolished. It was a fine specimen of
one of the few stone churches found in that part of the country, with
twelfth-century Gothic windows. The walls and pillars stand bare, the
roof has gone, and half the tower, whose bells lie buried on the ground
amid the wreckage. Desultory fighting continued at Nieuport after the
main German attack shifted south to Ypres.&mdash;[<i>Photo. by C.N.</i>]

<p>
The inhabitants of those parts of France and Belgium which are still
groaning under the German incubus are greatly to be pitied. Beyond the
terrible agony inflicted by the invaders upon defenceless populations,
in the form of executions and house-burnings and various forms of
outrage, there is a great mass of less drastic but still intolerable
misery to be borne by those unfortunate householders who are compelled
to house and feed the soldiers of the enemy. Some idea of the nature
of the infliction to which they are subjected can be gathered from
such a drawing as that here reproduced. It shows some officers of the
motor-corps of the Nineteenth German Army Corps asleep in a house upon
which they have been billeted. The drawing is by a German artist.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
